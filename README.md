### Screenshots of Trello board(s)
The Trello board helped me keep track of all the tasks required for the assessment.

## Design documentation
### Design process
My design idea takes inspiration from the Bower bird. These hard-working and industrious birds are black with a tinge of blue. 

They are known for their hardworking nature, and for building strong, simple and elegant nests and then decorating them with bright blue objects to create a striking point of difference from the other birds. 

My moodboard reflects this idea with: 
- lots of nature 
- simple, strong elegance with lots of black and white 
- tinges of striking bright blue to stand out from the black and white

### Moodboard

I created my moodboard with milanote: https://app.milanote.com/1H64Hp1OoNfM2t

### Colour schemes
To create my colour scheme I uploaded one of the images from the moodboard into the coolors website and clicked auto-generate until I found one that would provide enough shades and contrast to work with.

This website not only generates the palette from colours in the photograph but only generates colours that work well together so you can feel safe the colours will be appealing to the user.

### Fonts

To fit in with the themes discussed above, I've chosen fonts that are strong, simple and elegant. 

**Source Sans Pro:** because it is strong, clean and makes a good heading font

**Open Sans:** for body font because it is clean, very readable and provides a good complementary font to Source Sans Pro

**Bitter:** because it complements the other two fonts but its elegant serifs provide a good point of difference for headings and feature text.

### Wireframes

The wireframes were created in Figma. I created wireframes for both the homepage and content page (sub-page) template, covering three screen sizes - Desktop, Tablet and phone. The tablet and phone show continuous screens because content will fall below the fold. 

[Here is a pdf of the wireframes series](https://github.com/ewhiley/portfolio/blob/master/Portfolio_wireframes.pdf)

### Usability considerations

I have considered usability and accessibility in the design and development process. This includes:

* A colour palette that provides good contrast for accessibility

* Wireframes of different sizes to account for different screens

* Good sizing of text and good fonts for readability

* Good sizing of buttons for easy clicks

* No images used are informative (they are all decorative) so alt text was not necessary on images 

* Links are keyboard and screenreader accessible 

## Description of the website 

### Purpose

This project was to build a portfolio website to showcase myself as an aspiring developer, including information about my background, skills, work and study history, and ability to contact me.

### Target audience
Potential employers.

### Functionality / features
The website includes the following functionality and features:

- built using flexbox to make it responsive across different sized devices
- the website home page features a hero image from unsplash and css animation
- about section and skills section including developer icons and a button linked to an external LinkedIn page
- top navigation includes a logo that links to home page, as well as text hyperlinks to home, about, skills and contact
- the about and skills sections are linked with anchors, while the contact form has its own page
- the bottom navigation includes icons linked to contact, github and LinkedIn
- the contact form uses formspree to send input directly to my email address

### Sitemap

The sitemap consists of two pages.

### Tech stack (e.g. html, css, deployment platform, etc)
Built using HTML and CSS, deployed using Github in conjunction with Netlify, with a domain from VentraIP. 



## Short Answer Q&A - Include short answers to the following questions,

### Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)

Many say the internet began in 1969 with ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) that connected UCLA to Stanford. However, a key event happened in 1982 with the launch of TCP/IP. This created a standard protocol (a procedure that governs how data is transmitted) for computers to exchange information and created the internet we know today. 

In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee created HTML which is still used today and in 1991 the CERN developed the World Wide Web to the public. During the 90s, more and more websites were created by organisations as more and more users went online.

Various search engines were created which helped people search and navigate the web. In 1998 the Google search engine was launched and is the most widely used search engine today.

### Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)

We use web browsers as an application to view and access websites. Commonly known web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Apple Safari.

A Web server is a computer connected to the internet that runs software that enables it to provide information to users. When we type a url (web address) into our web browser the web server is what serves up the webpage to us. 

Domain names are words used in urls to identify specific Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Since IP addresses are made up of a combination of numbers, domain names make these addresses more memorable by replacing them with words.

Domain Name System (DNS) is the system that translates the domain names that we type into our web browsers into IP addresses so our browsers can load the content for us.

### Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)

An important development for the web has been the W3C standards for accessibility. 

The standards support social inclusion by promoting the creation of technology in a way that allows for people with disabilities, as well as older people, and people in rural areas or developing countries to be able to access and use it. 

These standards positively shape how web products are created by providing guidelines for developers to ensure their products meet these standards. By making simple provisions in the development process we can remove barriers for people with special needs. This includes providing alt text, as well as ensuring websites can be accessed by keyboard-only, and by screen readers. 

Without these standards the web would not be able to be as widely used as it is today.
