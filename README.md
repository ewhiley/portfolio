## Design documentation
### Design process
My design idea takes inspiration from the Bower bird. These hard-working and industrious birds are black with a tinge of blue. 

They are known for their hardworking nature, and for building strong, simple and elegant nests and then decorating them with bright blue objects to create a striking point of difference from the other birds. 

My moodboard reflects this idea with: 
- lots of nature 
- simple, strong elegance with lots of black and white 
- tinges of striking bright blue to stand out from the black and white

### Moodboard

I created my moodboard with milanote: https://app.milanote.com/1H64Hp1OoNfM2t

### Colour schemes
To create my colour scheme I uploaded one of the images from the moodboard into the coolors website and clicked auto-generate until I found one that would provide enough shades and contrast to work with.

This website not only generates the palette from colours in the photograph but only generates colours that work well together so you can feel safe the colours will be appealing to the user.

### Fonts

To fit in with the themes discussed above, I've chosen fonts that are strong, simple and elegant. 

**Source Sans Pro:** because it is strong, clean and makes a good heading font

**Open Sans:** for body font because it is clean, very readable and provides a good complementary font to Source Sans Pro

**Bitter:** because it complements the other two fonts but its elegant serifs provide a good point of different for headings and feature text.
