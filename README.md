## Design documentation
### Design process
My design idea takes inspiration from the Bower bird. These hard-working and industrious birds are black with a tinge of blue. 

They are known for their hardworking nature, and for building strong, simple and elegant nests and then decorating them with bright blue objects to create a striking point of difference from the other birds. 

My moodboard reflects this idea with: 
- lots of nature 
- simple, strong elegance with lots of black and white 
- tinges of striking bright blue to stand out from the black and white

### Moodboard

I created my moodboard with milanote: https://app.milanote.com/1H64Hp1OoNfM2t

### Colour schemes
To create my colour scheme I uploaded one of the images from the moodboard into the coolors website and clicked auto-generate until I found one that would provide enough shades and contrast to work with.

This website not only generates the palette from colours in the photograph but only generates colours that work well together so you can feel safe the colours will be appealing to the user.

### Fonts

To fit in with the themes discussed above, I've chosen fonts that are strong, simple and elegant. 

**Source Sans Pro:** because it is strong, clean and makes a good heading font

**Open Sans:** for body font because it is clean, very readable and provides a good complementary font to Source Sans Pro

**Bitter:** because it complements the other two fonts but its elegant serifs provide a good point of difference for headings and feature text.

### Wireframes

The wireframes were created in Figma. I created wireframes for both the homepage and content page (sub-page) template, covering three screen sizes - Desktop, Tablet and phone. The tablet and phone show continuous screens because content will fall below the fold. 

[Here is a pdf of the wireframes series](https://github.com/ewhiley/portfolio/blob/master/Portfolio_wireframes.pdf)

### Usability considerations

I have considered usability and accessibility in the design and development process. This includes:

* A colour palette that provides good contrast for accessibility

* Wireframes of different sizes to account for different screens

* Good sizing of text and good fonts for readability

* Good sizing of buttons for easy clicks

* No images used are informative (they are all decorative) so alt text was not necessary on images 

* Links are keyboard and screenreader accessible 

## Description of the website
